# README - Local environment to develop Python applications

Python version is managed with Pyenv, and a virtual environment is created to manage project dependencies

# How to use this repository

* Make sure of the requirements are installed.

* make a clone of repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CesarBallardini/localenv-python
```

You can customize the values if you like.  If you let the default values, it will be OK.

## Manage the VM's lifecycle

* launch the VM:

```bash
cd localenv-python/
cp Vagrantfile.virtualbox Vagrantfile ; time vagrant up  # uses Virtualbox as provider

# o bien
cp Vagrantfile.docker Vagrantfile ;  time vagrant up  # uses Docker as provider, ie. on Apple MAC with M1 processor

```

The `vagrant up` command creates an Ubuntu 22.04 node called `pydev`.  The network is _host only_, so you can access it from the host (PC or laptop).

You can access with SSH:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

You can stop the VM:

```bash
vagrant halt
```

And you can destroy it:

```bash
vagrant destroy -f
```
